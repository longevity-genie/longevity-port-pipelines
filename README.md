# LongevityPort — cross-species protein interaction analysis

![Poster overview](docs/poster/poster.png)

> **Prototype status.** This is a preliminary computational signal check — built in ~1 week
> to see whether protein interface divergence in long-lived species is detectable before
> committing to a full proposal (Biswas Family Foundation Fast Grants, $50K AI + health).
> The code produces results, but the analysis has known limitations (see
> [Pilot results & roadmap](docs/PILOT_RESULTS.md)). Treat the outputs as promising
> preliminary data, not validated biological claims.

## The big picture

Some species live extraordinarily long: naked mole-rats (~31 yr), bowhead whales (~211 yr),
and certain bats (~41 yr). One hypothesis is that their **protein-protein interactions**
have diverged — key interactions are maintained, broken, or rewired compared to short-lived
species (mouse ~3 yr, human ~80 yr).

The central question is fine-grained: not just *"is the long-lived-species protein different
from the human one?"* but *does the ortholog differ especially strongly at the amino acids
that participate in interaction with its partner?* If the changes concentrate at the
interface, this may indicate altered binding specificity, remodeling of the complex, or
preservation of a critical surface — exactly what we need to judge whether a variant is
portable.

This repo tackles two complementary questions:
1. **Which proteins should we investigate?** — candidate & interactome analysis (Tasks A-D, no GPU)
2. **Do protein interfaces actually diverge?** — embedding signal check (Stages 1-7, Biohub API)

        S6 --> S7[Plots]
    end
    D -.-> S1
```

**Tasks A-D** run on a laptop (no GPU, no API keys): curate longevity proteins, map their
interactome from OmniPath, flag hub proteins, score on 10 wet-lab feasibility criteria, and
generate a breakage taxonomy for human curation.

**Stages 1-7** test the interface divergence hypothesis: take a known complex with a solved
3D structure, embed each chain with ESM C (via Biohub REST API), swap one chain for the
ortholog from a long-lived species, re-embed, and check whether the embedding shift
concentrates at interface residues. The deliverable is an enrichment table + plots with
two negative controls (shuffled mask + NEGATOME).

## Prerequisites

You need **two things**:

1. **Python 3.13+** — check with `python3 --version`
2. **uv** — a fast Python package manager (replaces pip/conda/virtualenv):
   ```bash
   curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
   ```

That's it. No conda environments, no Docker, no system-level packages.

## Setup (2 minutes)

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/longevity-genie/longevity-port-pipelines.git
cd longevity-port-pipelines

# Install all dependencies into a local .venv (automatic, no activation needed)
uv sync
```

> **What is `uv run`?** It runs a command inside the project's virtual environment without
> you having to activate it. Think of it as `conda run` but instant. Every command in this
> README uses `uv run <name>`.

## Candidate preparation (Tasks A-D)

Run these in order. Each command writes CSV/parquet files to `data/output/`.

### Step 1 — Generate candidate protein list

```bash
uv run candidates
```

**What it does:** Writes a curated list of 32 longevity-relevant human proteins across 8
functional categories to `data/output/candidates.csv`.

**What you get:**

```
gene_name  uniprot_id  category                     description
SIRT1      Q96EB6      pro-longevity                NAD-dependent deacetylase, master metabolic sensor
TP53       P04637      dna-repair                   Tumor suppressor, genome guardian
HAS2       Q92819      ecm/hyaluronan               Hyaluronan synthase 2, NMR high-MW-HA producer
CIRBP      Q14011      stress-response/cold-shock   Cold-inducible RNA-binding protein
CGAS       Q8N884      inflammation/cGAS-STING      Cyclic GMP-AMP synthase, cytosolic DNA sensor
...        ...         ...                          ...
```

**Categories:** pro-longevity (7), DNA repair (5), inflammation/cGAS-STING (4),
proteostasis (4), mitochondrial stress (3), senescence (3), ECM/hyaluronan (3),
stress response/cold shock (3).

> **Want to add your own proteins?** Edit `src/longevity_port_pipelines/stages/candidates.py`
> and add a `CandidateProtein(...)` entry. You need the gene name and UniProt ID
> (look it up at [uniprot.org](https://www.uniprot.org/)).

### Step 2 — Fetch interactome data

```bash
uv run interactome
```

**What it does:** Queries [OmniPath](https://omnipathdb.org/) — a meta-database that
aggregates STRING, BioGRID, IntAct, Reactome, SIGNOR, and 100+ other sources — for every
candidate protein in one bulk API call. Then fetches UniProt annotations (molecular weight,
subcellular location, glycosylation) for each protein.

**What you get (2 files):**

`data/output/interactome.csv` — one row per candidate:

```
gene_name  n_partners  is_hub  databases                           top_partners
SIRT1      248         true    BioGRID, IntAct, SIGNOR, ...        FOXO3, TP53, NFE2L2, ...
CIRBP      18          true    OmniPath, SIGNOR, ...               RBM3, EIF4G1, ...
```

`data/output/interactome_partners.parquet` — full interaction list (one row per pair).

**Key concept — hub proteins:** Proteins with >15 interaction partners are flagged as
"hubs". Porting a hub protein across species risks destabilising its entire interaction
network (the "mTOR-like rewiring" problem). Hubs aren't excluded — they're just scored
lower in the validation step.

### Step 3 — Generate breakage taxonomy table

```bash
uv run breakage-table
```

**What it does:** Creates a table crossing each candidate protein with each target species,
listing known functional and regulatory/degradation partners.

**What you get:** `data/output/breakage_taxonomy.csv`

```
protein  species          functional_partners  regulatory_partners  desired_interaction_state
SIRT1    naked_mole_rat   FOXO3, TP53, ...     MDM2, UBE2I, ...     (fill in)
SIRT1    bowhead_whale    FOXO3, TP53, ...     MDM2, UBE2I, ...     (fill in)
HAS2     naked_mole_rat   CD44, RHAMM, ...                          (fill in)
```

**Your job:** Fill in the `desired_interaction_state` column with one of:
- `maintained` — this interaction should be preserved in the long-lived species
- `broken` — this interaction should be disrupted (e.g., pro-aging pathway)
- `rewired` — the interaction changes partners or strength

This is the biological hypothesis — the computational pipeline then tests it.

### Step 4 — Score candidates + generate protocol

```bash
uv run validation-protocol
```

**What it does:** Scores each candidate on 10 binary criteria and generates a prioritised
ranking plus SVG plots.

**Scoring criteria (10 points max):**

| # | Criterion | Why it matters |
|---|-----------|---------------|
| 1 | Has AlphaFold structure | Can we model it? |
| 2 | Has human ortholog | Always true (we start from human) |
| 3 | Has known interactors | Is there a network to analyse? |
| 4 | Not a hub (<=15 partners) | Hubs risk network-wide side effects |
| 5 | Assay-feasible (soluble, <80 kDa) | Can we test it in the lab? |
| 6 | Has breakage hypothesis | Did you fill in the breakage table? |
| 7 | Cell-free expressible | Works in Adaptyv's cell-free system? |
| 8 | Under 80 kDa | Size constraint for cell-free expression |
| 9 | Not membrane protein | Membrane proteins are hard to express |
| 10 | No glycosylation needed | Cell-free systems can't glycosylate |

**Priority tiers:** HIGH (8-10), MEDIUM (5-7), LOW (0-4)

**What you get (4 files):**

- `data/output/validation_scores.csv` — full scored table
- `data/output/validation_protocol.md` — formatted protocol document
- `data/output/plots/priority_scores.svg` — bar chart by priority tier
- `data/output/plots/hub_vs_score.svg` — scatter: partner count vs score
- `data/output/plots/category_breakdown.svg` — mean score per category

## Interface embedding pipeline (Stages 1-7)

After you have your prioritised candidates, this pipeline tests whether cross-species
sequence divergence concentrates at protein-protein interfaces.

**Embeddings use the Biohub REST API** (ESM C 600M/6B) — no local GPU required.
Set your API token in `.env` (copy from `.env.template`).

```bash
uv run select              # Load PINDER PPI dataset, filter, annotate hubs
uv run orthologs           # Fetch orthologs for long-lived species
# >>> Review data/output/selection.csv and ortholog_coverage.csv <<<
uv run embed               # Per-residue embeddings via Biohub API
uv run analyze             # Enrichment analysis (interface vs non-interface)
uv run plot                # Summary plots
```

Or run all stages at once:

```bash
uv run run-pipeline                  # everything
uv run run-pipeline --pre-gpu-only   # stop after stage 4 (audit checkpoint)
```

## Pilot results

The v2 pilot (43 complexes, 13,415 residue-level deltas) produced a preliminary signal.
The strongest hit: **8bhv XLF/NHEJ1** (NHEJ DNA repair) shows enrichment ~2.59 in
naked mole-rat and ~2.34 in mouse — embedding divergence concentrated at the binding
surface. The method also distinguishes **interface-constrained** candidates (preserved
surface, safer to port) from **interface-divergent** ones (remodeled, higher risk).

Main limitations: missing NEGATOME negative controls, no long-lived vs short-lived
contrast yet. See [docs/PILOT_RESULTS.md](docs/PILOT_RESULTS.md) for the full table,
statistics, limitations, and roadmap.

├── input/     IN GIT      — user-curated files (custom_candidates.csv)
├── interim/   GITIGNORED  — cached API responses (UniProt, PINDER, STRING, Foldseek)
└── output/    GITIGNORED  — pipeline outputs (CSVs, embeddings, enrichment, plots)
```

All `interim/` and `output/` files are regenerable by running the pipeline commands above.
Only `data/input/` is committed to git.
